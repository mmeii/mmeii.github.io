# Portfolio

This repository now contains the source for the IAMMEI portfolio built with React and Vite.  

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # start local dev server
npm run build # create production bundle in dist/
```

The static assets (images, favicon, and CNAME) live in `public/` so they are copied directly into the production build.
